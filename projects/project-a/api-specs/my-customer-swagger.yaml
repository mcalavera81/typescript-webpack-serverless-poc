                This field maintains a link between the Customer and their Accounts.
                Internal Accounts are recognised by ID''s which contain a Currency
                Code in the first 3 characters. These do not belong to Customers.

                1-10 numeric character Customer Code or 3-10 type MNE (uppercase alpha
                or numeric or ''.'') character Customer Mnemonic. (Mandatory input
                for Customer Accounts not allowed for Internal Accounts). Can only
                be changed for Nostro accounts. A change is only allowed if the account
                is not specified in the EXT.ACCT.NO field of the AGENCY record for
                the old Customer number. Input here will be checked against the account
                number if an entry has been made in the customer code position on
                account parameter. This check is for account numbers that contain
                the customer code, the position within account number being specified
                by account parameter.

                Customer number can be changed only if the Account category 1000 to
                9999 is specified in the field range ACCT.CATEG.STR and ACCT.CATEG.END
                of ACCOUNT.PARAMETER. This will allow change only if the account has
                joint holders and also allows the change only to a joint holder customer.

                Cannot change the customer if there are LIMITS attached to the account,
                if it is  single customer account without joint holders and if the
                account has been input as an AUTO.PAY.ACCOUNT or SUB ACCOUNT in another
                account with same main customer and currency.

                Will allow change to Nostro accounts even if the account category
                is specified in ACCOUNT.PARAMETER.
